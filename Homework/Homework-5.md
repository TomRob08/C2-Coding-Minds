# TV Show Quotes

## Instructions:

Define a Show class with the following member variables and methods:

- Variables:
  - name: a string representing the name of the TV show
- Methods:
  - quote(): a virtual method that outputs a quote from the TV show to the console.

Define three classes that inherit from a show: The Office, Avatar The Last Airbender, and Stranger Things. Each class should override the quote() method to output a different quote from the show:

- The Office: outputs "Identity theft is not a joke, Jim!"
- Avatar The Last Airbender: outputs "Sometimes life is like this dark tunnel. You can't always see the light at the end of the tunnel, but if you just keep moving... you will come to a better place."
- Stranger Things: outputs "Friends don't lie."

In the main() function, create an object of each Show subclass and use them to output a quote from the show to the console.

**You can either use the shows and quotes above or you can use some of your favorite shows**
