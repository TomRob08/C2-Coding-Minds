# Splitting classes into different files

## Why should you do this?
C++ classes can become quite large and complex, especially in larger programs. Splitting a class up into different files can make the code more organized and easier to manage. Here are a few reasons why C++ classes should be split up into different files:

- Modularity: By splitting a class up into different files, you can create smaller, more modular pieces of code. This can make it easier to read and understand the code, and can also make it easier to test and maintain.

- Reusability: Splitting a class up into different files can make it easier to reuse pieces of code in other parts of your program or in other programs. You can also share these files with other developers who may want to use your code.

- Compilation: Large classes can take a long time to compile, which can slow down the development process. By splitting a class up into different files, you can compile only the files that have been changed, which can save time.

- Collaboration: If you are working on a team, splitting a class up into different files can make it easier for multiple developers to work on the same code at the same time without causing conflicts.

- Readability: Splitting a class up into different files can make it easier to read and understand the code. It can also make it easier to find specific pieces of code if you need to make changes or add new features.
