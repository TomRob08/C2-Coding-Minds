# Introduction to classes

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
In C++, Object-Oriented Programming is implemented using classes, which are user-defined types that encapsulate data and functions that operate on that data. Classes provide a blueprint or template for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class, created by calling the class constructor. The object has its own set of member variables (also called data members) and member functions (also called methods) that operate on those variables.

## Classes
A class in OOP is the name of a type of thing. Think of the word classification. We classify everything around us. Imagine a world where we only referred to anything as "a thing." Cars are now "things," and so are dogs, and so is everything else. It'd be pretty confusing, wouldn't it? How would conversations go? We would constantly be asking each other to be more descriptive all the time.

Such is why we classify things and give nouns names. It gets the idea across much faster. If I said "My thing rolled over," you'd have nothing to go on. But what if I said "My dog rolled over?" Or how about "My car rolled over?"

What can we conclude from this thought experiment? It's that classifications carry meaning. When someone says "a car," you know they're talking about something large, made of metal, with four wheels. When someone says "a dog," you know that they're talking about an animal with fur and four legs.

## Example
Let's continue with looking at the dog class.

**What are some characteristics for most dogs?**

**What are some activites dogs do?**

For this example we will use the dog's characteristics for it's member variables and the activites for it's member functions
