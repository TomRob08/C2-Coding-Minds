# Introduction to classes

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
In C++, Object-Oriented Programming is implemented using classes, which are user-defined types that encapsulate data and functions that operate on data. Classes provide a blueprint or template for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class, created by calling the class constructor. The object has its own set of member variables and member functions that operate on those variables.

## Classes
A class in OOP is the name of a type of thing. Think of the word classification. We classify everything around us. Imagine a world where we only referred to anything as "a thing." Cars are now "things," and so are dogs, and so is everything else. It'd be pretty confusing, wouldn't it? How would conversations go? We would constantly be asking each other to be more descriptive all the time.

Such is why we classify things and give nouns names. It gets the idea across much faster. If I said "My thing rolled over," you'd have nothing to go on. But what if I said "My dog rolled over?" Or how about "My car rolled over?"

What can we conclude from this thought experiment? It's that classifications carry meaning. When someone says "a car," you know they're talking about something large, made of metal, with four wheels. When someone says "a dog," you know that they're talking about an animal with fur and four legs.

## Example
Let's continue with looking at the dog class.

**What are some characteristics for most dogs?**

**What are some activites dogs do?**

For this example we will use the dog's characteristics for it's member variables and the activites for it's member functions.

## Objects
In OOP, you can have many objects of the same class, but with different qualities. Your pet dog (if you have one) is an instance of a Dog class. And your teacher's pet dog (if they have one) is also an instance of the Dog class. Of course, those two dogs are not the exact same. They might differ in breed, age, and more, but no matter what they are still of the class Dog. In OOP, objects are allowed to be different from each other - the only thing they share is that they are of the same type.

Using the dog class we can define different breeds as objects because they are all under the same classification and share similarities with one another.

Let's use the information gained in this lesson and create a dog class with objects associated with it in a C++ program.
