# Class Inheritance

C++ class inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class, known as the derived class, to be based on an existing class, known as the base class. In this way, the derived class can inherit the properties and behaviors of the base class, which can be used to extend or modify the behavior of the derived class.

To create a derived class in C++, you declare it with the class keyword followed by the class name and the keyword public, private, or protected followed by the name of the base class. For example:
```
class DerivedClass : public BaseClass {
  // class definition here
};
```
